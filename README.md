# Timeblocks.io
## Overview
  Timeboxes.io is an application that allows users to manage their time by building as many customized timeboxes as they want for whatever purpose they like. TImeboxes can be made however the user likes, they can be used to tell the time anywhere in the world in whatever format they desire. Time boxes can be placed in series, in parallel, as timers, as alarms, in logical succession and placed on the users dashboard for easy access. Timeboxes can be shared with others, whether as an alarm, time synchronizer, or as a timeblock in the distant future.
